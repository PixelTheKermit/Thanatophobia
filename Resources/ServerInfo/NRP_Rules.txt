[color=#ff0000]ZERO TOLERANCE RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]02.[/color] Absolutely no hate speech, slurs, bigotry, racism, specism (demeaning other characters in-game due to their in-game race), sexism, disability-related or anything even remotely similar. (YOU WILL GET PERMABANNED)

[color=#ff0000]GENERAL ETIQUETTE[/color]

[color=#a4885c]05.[/color] These are English servers. Speak only English in IC and OOC.

[color=#a4885c]06.[/color] Don't use exploits or external programs to play, gain an advantage, or disrupt/crash the round/server. This includes autoclickers and scripts to automate the game or evade AFK detection. Intentionally attempting to lag/crash the server will result in an immediate appeal-only ban.

[color=#a4885c]07.[/color] Don't use multiple SS14 accounts to play (referred to as "multi-keying"). Users knowingly using multiple SS14 accounts will have all of their accounts banned.

[color=#a4885c]08.[/color] Do not ignore the admin help relay or abuse it by flooding it with garbage, checking for admins before stating a problem (ex: "hello?", "any admins?"), using it as a chatroom, or sending messages of no substance. Hostility to administators in the relay will likely result in your removal.

[color=#ff0000]IN GAME RULES[/color]

[color=#a4885c]09.[/color] Pick a realistic name that could appear on a birth certificate with at least a first and last name (leeway is given to this for non-human races).
    - Names of notable famous or fictional persons or names that resemble/parody them are strictly forbidden. You are not clever if you slightly change a famous name around. Terrible names open you up to being politely reminded to change it, smited, or instantly banned, depending on severity.
    - Names resulting in inappropriate phonetic play-on-words are forbidden (ex: "Mike Oxlong", "Ben Dover", "Dixie Normus"). They are also extremely overdone.

[color=#a4885c]10.[/color] Don't be a dick. You are playing a multiplayer game with other people who also want to enjoy the game.

[color=#a4885c]11.[/color] Don't harass players across rounds for actions in prior rounds or for actions outside of the game.
