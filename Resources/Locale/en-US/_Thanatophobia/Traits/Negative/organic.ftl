                               "Sometimes those who are reconstructed with additional genetic information appear with missing limbs. It is recommended that those who have this happen to them seek a replacement as soon as possible. Organic is best (yet can take a while to attach or grow.) Modern prosthetics are quicker to apply (but may feel sluggish, and also require a constant charge.)"
