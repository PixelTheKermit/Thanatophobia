tp-trait-human-tail-name = Mutation: Tail
tp-trait-human-tail-description = You have a tail. Useful for dragging things around.

                                  "The first accidental mutation on humans. The old reconstructors always left some residue behind after each reconstruction, and so it was important that we cleaned these as much as possible. However, I guess we must have gotten a bit clumsy one day, and we got a human with a scaly tail."

tp-trait-human-wings-name = Mutation: Wings
tp-trait-human-wings-description = You have a pair of wings. Makes it easier to move around zero-grav enviroments.

                                   "This... didn't work as easily as you would think. Humans are much heavier than expected, and therefore more effort had to be put into this working rather than 'oh, just drop a bunch of feathers in there!' A few modifications later, and we got it to work."

tp-trait-human-webs-name = Mutation: Weaver
tp-trait-human-webs-description = You can weave webs and make objects out of them.

                                  "The second mutation that was attempted. This time we tried it on multiple other species rather than humans. Although it proved unsuccessful for most, humans had zero issues with it whatsoever, although it did cause another major appearance change."

tp-trait-human-bloom-name = Mutation: Bloom
tp-trait-human-bloom-description = You're able to ingest plant related chems and gain their effects.

                                   "So some people [italic]really[/italic] want to drink the stuff that's meant to go into plants for some reason? Apparently it's a new trend or something? Well, we figured out how they could do that safely, so hopefully people stop killing themselves with toxic solutions. Do they know how expensive this stuff is?"

tp-trait-human-slime-lungs-name = Mutation: Slimy Lungs
tp-trait-human-slime-lungs-description = Your lungs can use nitrogen to breathe.

                                         "We don't fucking know how this worked. We just shoved a bunch of slime into the reconstructor and it did something! And we just simply cloned the DNA after the test so now we can grant this to any human at any time."
