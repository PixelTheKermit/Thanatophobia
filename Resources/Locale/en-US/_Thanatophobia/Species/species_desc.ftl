tp-species-description-Human = [font size=14][bold][color=yellow]Human[/bold][/color][/font]

                               A miserable pile of secrets that you already know a lot about. Not much else can be said about this blank canvas, yet advances in genetic research proved them to be more adaptable to physical and mental changes.

tp-species-description-Arachnid = [font size=14][bold][color=purple]Arachnid[/bold][/color][/font]

                                  A humanoid creature with similar behaviours to the common web-weaving spider. Observations showed that they're mostly territorial. They're also way more skilled in using fibers like silk and are able to use them without the need for special tools. They used to not use names, yet after human discovery, they took an interest to the old latin language and started using a combination of two latin words for their names.

                                  Due to arachnids basically being larger spiders, they abide by the same rules that other big spiders do. Mainly they need to ensure they have a steady source of oxygen, as lacking it will hurt them way more and recovery from it takes longer when compared to other animals. Their metabolisms are also quite slow, which means any chemicals in their bodies will last longer. Finally, their blood takes a [color=cornflowerblue]bluer colour[/color], which is due to them having copper in their blood instead of iron. This does affect their treatments, so be careful.

tp-species-description-Diona = [font size=14][bold][color=brown]Diona[/bold][/color][/font]

                               Dionas are the first iteration of a soul being moved into a new organic body. Some time ago there was a mistake somewhere in an alien planet which resulted in someone going MIA. In a turn of events researchers were able to find a plant person replacing what used to be a human, with the same memories that they had. A sample was taken of the plant which was deducted to be the cause of it and the whole event acted as a start into the research of full body reconstruction and soul transversal.

                               Dionas, as simply just big moving plants, are affected by the same chemicals all regular plants are. They also need to eat and drink a lot less due to slower metabolism rates. Structurally they're like a tree, being resistant to slash and blunt damage yet being highly vulnerable to fire. Their unique form also disallows them from being able to wear any shoes.

tp-species-description-SlimePerson = [font size=14][bold][color=lime]Slime Person[/bold][/color][/font]

                                     The first human-made vessel for a soul. A being formed from clear slime containing basic organs and a singular slime core which is where the actual soul resides. They share similar biology to the slime creatures, yet unlike slime creatures their base form is human-like, they have vocal chords and their behaviours are a lot less feral.

                                     Slimes are able to injest more chemicals than other species currently known due to how their biology works, and their slimy bodies allow for way better healing of their structure. However, slime people should try and avoid contact with water as much as possible, as the slime they're made from will dissolve easily. But don't worry! In the worst case senario, you don't have to worry as you won't leave a stinky mess of a rotting corpse, just a really sticky and slimy one.

tp-species-description-Reptilian = [font size=14][bold][color=green]Reptilian[/bold][/color][/font]

                                   A humanoid being with close resemblance to a lizard. They usually prefer working together to perform strength intensive work. They're also known to be picky eaters and prefer to eat meats and fruits. Their names traditionally used to be something like Verb the Noun, but some new-gen lizards go for something different entirely.

                                   Most reptilians use their tails for dragging large and heavy cargo, freeing up their hands for anything else and making them quite useful in cargo related jobs. However, their relation to lizards also extends to their cold-blooded nature, meaning they're more vulnerable to cold temperatures, so it's harder for them to preform work in colder enviroments.

                               Just a reminder for me to code in size sliders.

tp-species-description-Moth = [font size=14][bold][color=papayawhip]Moth Person[/bold][/color][/font]

                              A humanoid creature with similar features to that of an earth moth, hence their human given name. They became the first sentient species humans were able to discover without ending up in a war with, notably because most moth people are peaceful creatures, with zero intention of war. Moth names are typically something to do with flight but recently there's been a mixture of that and human names.

                              Their digestive systems allow for the consumption of any fiberous material like cloth and webs, yet unfortunately they're unable to consume any other solid foods, limiting their diets heavily. They also boast the quite obvious feature, their wings, which aren't there for show. Moth people are able to use their wings to glide through places, and if the gravity is low enough, they're actually able to fly.

                                  Happy halloween!

tp-species-description-Vox =  [font size=14][bold][color=yellow]Vox[/bold][/color][/font]

                              Wait Voxes were added? Oh boy I need to write lore for them.
