                        Meant to resemble the spade symbol on playing cards, the Spade is a common ship found in the wild due to their cheap manufacturing costs and high reliability. Despite its high usage, it's disliked by quite a bit of people, mainly the claustrophobic, who have have reported high discomfort when using the product.

                        It is armed with [bold]4 SOW-B7s[/bold] on the left and right sides of the ship, and comes with 1 [color=purple][bold]P.A.C.M.A.N.[/bold][/color] generator, which has enough to power the ship [italic]for only a few minutes[/italic]. Additional [color=orange]ammo[/color] and [color=purple]fuel[/color] is provided within the shuttle. A common modification made to these is the inclusion of an atmospherics system, as this ship does not actually come with one in the first place. This is a reported problem yet no one knows if the production team behind this plans to resolve this issue.

tp-ui-ship-name-Star = Star
tp-ui-ship-desc-Star = [font size=14][bold][color=yellow]Star[/bold][/color][/font]

                       A shuttle with the resemblance of a 4 pointed star, mainly used by traders due to how easily they can be spotted. It's not really meant to be used for combat, and therefore lacks in any serious firepower.

                       The ship uses [bold]8 BLG-4s[/bold], one on each side of the ship, that are all powered with 3 rechargable [color = red]batteries[/color]. Some users usually try to switch out the guns with something better as soon as possible, as the guns aren't that strong, yet others usually try to obtain more batteries to make the guns last longer. It comes with a [italic]basic yet messy[/italic] atmospherics system that includes a canister of air and an empty canister to fill with waste gas. Additionally, the ship runs on 1 [color = green][bold]S.U.P.E.R.P.A.C.M.A.N[/bold][/color] and comes with the fuel nessessary to use it.

tp-ui-ship-name-Piracy = Piracy
tp-ui-ship-desc-Piracy = [font size=14][bold][color=yellow]Piracy[/bold][/color][/font]

                         A shuttle used by those who want to feel like one of those old-time pirates... or simply don't have a lot of money on them. This is one of the cheapest ships on the market, and its price speaks for it's quality.

                         The shuttle is strapped to the teeth with [bold]Cannons[/bold], firing big, [color = gray][bold]stone balls[/bold][/color] at enemy ships. And that's the only decent thing about this ship. It has only one room, with nowhere to sleep except the cold, wood floor. It has no substation or battery, which makes it really inefficient at storing power, and it's generator is only a [color=purple][bold]P.A.C.M.A.N.[/bold][/color] generator. At least it has a functional atmospherics system...
