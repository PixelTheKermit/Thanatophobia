                       A star shaped ship based around scientific research.

                       It comes with an additional generator, battery powered ship guns, and an atmospherics system that mixes oxygen and nitrogen itself instead of relying on pre-made air canisters. The atmospherics system also captures all the bad air into a canister which can then be recycled or just emptied in space. TODO: FINISH.

                         An ancient shuttle made long ago that fits the theme of being an old timey pirate.

                         This ship has multiple thrusters, granting decent control over the whole ship. When paired with the [color=gray]cannons[/color] lined up on both sides of the ship, the ship is quite decent for running and gunning. However, since the ship is quite old, there have been a few [color=pink]mistakes[/color] in it's design: mainly the thrusters. The one good selling point of the ship now backstabs you and drains your whole ship's power. Therefore it is [color=yellow]advised[/color] that the buyer of the ship does either two things. 1) Get another generator, and provide more power as soon as possible or 2) detach the thrusters from the ship.

                         Once you have resolved that huge issue, you should be fine to go around and sail the seven galaxies. Good luck.
