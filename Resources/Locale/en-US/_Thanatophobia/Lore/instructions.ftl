                           A quick and easy guide on how to use your ship's generator.[/bold][/head]

                           So, you're looking at that new generator on your ship and you may be thinking "How do I get this thing to generate power for my ship?" Well, thankfully you have this very useful guide with you!

                           First of all: Is your generator connected over any MV/HV cables? If you are unsure, check if there is any yellow/orange wiring underneath your generator. Also, check if your generator can move. If it can, [bold]try to anchor it down to the floor using a wrench.[/bold] If the generator isn't fixed to the ground, it is unlikely to work.

                           Then: Change the output of the generator based on the wiring underneath. [color=yellow]If there are any yellow wires, change the output to MV.[/color] [color=orange]If it's orange, change it to HV.[/color] [bold]It is recommended to use an MV output if you do not have a proper power setup.[/bold]

                           Lastly: Fuel the generator with the required fuel, most commonly plasma or uranium. Tug the cord a few times and boom! Power!
